# Regression in R

This is a quick introduction to the concept of regression analysis. 

## Linear Regression 

Linear regression is a statistical method for obtaining a prediction of an outcome

from an observed variable.

### The Regression Equation


The prediction takes the form of a linear equation for the prediction of 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Y_i"> 
as a linear combination of the variables

multiplied by the parameter

plus an intercept

### The Minimization Problem

The parameters

and
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta_0">
are estimated by minimizing the sum of squared residuals from the regression line defined by
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta_1"> 
and
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta_0">.
The residuals are the differerences from the observed values

from the values predicted by the regression line.

### The Fit of a Regression Model

The quality of fit of a regression model is determined by the degree to which the observations fit close to the regression line. 
It is represented by the statistic 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r^2">, 
pronounced "R-squared."
This statistic ranges from 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r^2 = 1">, 
for a model that fits the data perfectly,
to 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r^2 = 0">, 
if the dependent variable 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Y_i">
is unrelated to the explanatory variable
