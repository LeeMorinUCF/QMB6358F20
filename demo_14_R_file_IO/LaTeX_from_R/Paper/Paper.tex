\section{Data}

Summary statistics for numerical variables are shown in Table \ref{tab:summary}. 

\input{../Tables/summary.tex}


Table \ref{tab:earthquakes} shows the frequency of observations in and out of California along with the incidence of earthquakes. Notice that earthquakes have only happened in California. 

\input{../Tables/earthquakes.tex}

The correlation matrix of potential variables in the model is shown in Table \ref{tab:corr}. 
House prices are positively correlated with income and California but negatively correlated with earthquakes. In the next setion, these variables will be included in a regression model. 

\input{../Tables/correlation.tex}

The regression lines are shown in Figure \ref{fig:reg}, with the estimated intercept term for zip codes affected by earthquakes (red), those in the rest of California (green), and the zip codes outside of California.
