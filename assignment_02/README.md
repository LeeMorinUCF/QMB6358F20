# Assignment 2

## Gradual Improvements

It is often useful to complete software development in stages. 
Working through the above assignment, you might tackle one element at a time. 
For example, you could focus on one function first. 
You can comment out the tests of the other function in ```Q2_testing.R```. 
Then you can add improvements as you work through the stages of the function design recipe. 
Once you solve a particular problem or end a working session, it is good practice to ```add```, ```commit``` and ```push``` your intermediate results to your repository. 
This saves a copy of your results and also provides an intermediate solution that you can use to ask for feedback from others (such as your instructor).
I will check your repos on Thursday, September 10 (even though there is no lecture that day) so that I can give you feedback on your functions, if necessary. 
This strategy matches the practice typically followed in software engineering. 

## Deadlines vs. Continuous Delivery

In software development, products are improved in increments, beginning with the simplest working prototype (called a Minimum Viable Product - MVP), rather than have the customer wait for a long time to get the finished version.

Notice in the figure above, the finished product is different because the engineers were able to get feedback from the customer who was using the intermediate products. 
This is in contrast to the traditional product engineering workflow that you might be more familiar with, called the "waterfall" approach. In this framework, engineering designs flow downward from the initial definition. In contrast, in the "Agile" approach, there is a sequence of incremental improvements on a working product that the customer can use.

Although the waterfall approach is suitable and necessary for some very large products, software is typically developed with the Agile approach in mind.
